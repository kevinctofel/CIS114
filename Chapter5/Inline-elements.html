        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am <b>extremely</b> excited about a new
            cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide
            cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
            in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
            set to the target temperature you want the food
            to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Coding for Geeks</cite>,
            Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
            poaching</q>.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
            with Dill Hollandaise. <br>To reserve a seat at the chef
            table, contact us before November 30.

        <p><em><small>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
            pastuerized. Avoid it if you are pregenant or have
            immunity issues.</small></em>
